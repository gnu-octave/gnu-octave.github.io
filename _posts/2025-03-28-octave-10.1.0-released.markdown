GNU Octave version 10.1.0 has been released and is now available for
[download][1].  An official [Windows binary installer][2] is available.
For [macOS][3] see the installation instructions in the wiki.

This major release contains many new and improved functions.  Among other
things, it brings updates for Matlab compatibility (notably a substantial
overhaul of the moving window functions) and performance improvements for
some built-in functions.  A list of important user-visible changes is
available by selecting the [Release Notes][4] item in the News menu of
the GUI or by typing `news` at the Octave command prompt.

Thanks to the many people who contributed to this release!
