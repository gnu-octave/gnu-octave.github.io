This page should clarify about the various entities and actors around the GNU Octave programming language.

### GNU Octave

The **GNU Octave** project was initialized 1992 by
[John W. Eaton &lt;jwe@octave.org&gt;](mailto:jwe@octave.org).
It consists of a
[software source code repository](https://hg.octave.org/octave)
and a community of people who work on that code.
The most clear cut line that can be drawn is that there is a
[set of people](https://savannah.gnu.org/project/memberlist.php?group=octave)
who have commit access to the source code repository:
there are currently 24 committers (10 active and 14 dormant).
This set of people doesn’t really define the entire project.
Additionally, there are many people who are prolific contributors
to the GNU Octave ecosystem but who do not have
“[commit bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committer#Commit_bit).”
The communal nature of open-source makes it difficult to precisely define
where the GNU Octave project ends and the greater community begins,
which is exactly how we like it.
Finally,
most development decisions are made by or agreed with
John W. Eaton.

#### Contributor Agreement

By submitting patches to the  **GNU Octave** project,
you agree to the following conditions:

1. Your contribution will be released under the terms of the GNU GPL,
   version 3 or any later version.
2. Your contribution must be an independent work or derived from code
   that may be released under the terms of the GPL.
   Under no circumstances may it be based on code from Matlab
   or other non-free code that you may have access to view.
3. In the Octave source code, all files are marked with a copyright statement
   that says

   > Copyright (C) YYYY-YYYY The Octave Project Developers.

   This copyright notice is used to ease the burden of maintaining copyright
   information in the source files,
   not to diminish or remove credit for contributions.
   Detailed information about what changes have been made and who has made them
   is maintained in the revision history of the Octave sources.

   If you wish, you will be credited as a contributor in the Octave documentation.

### NumFOCUS

Since 2022 the GNU Octave project receives donations
from both individuals and corporations with the kind support from
[NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/project/gnu-octave),
a 501(c)(3) public charity in the United States of America.

How donations are spent is decided by Octave core developers
led by John W. Eaton.

For full transparency about collected donations
and how they helped improving the GNU Octave project,
please visit <https://opencollective.com/gnu-octave>.

### Free Software Foundation (FSF)

Despite the free usage of the FSF infrastructure for distributing
the GNU Octave source code,
the Octave project does not receive any direct or indirect
monetary funding by the FSF.

Before 2022 the FSF helped the GNU Octave project
to receive donations from both individuals and corporations.

### Related organizations with no governance role

There are organizations that people sometimes mistakenly believe
have some kind of official control over the GNU Octave project.
This section details three of them,
but please note that they have neither any official relationship
nor any governance capacity with the GNU Octave project.

#### Octave Forge and Octave Packages

**Octave Forge** <https://octave.sourceforge.io/> is the former collection
of software packages, that can be easily installed and used with GNU Octave.
The Octave SourceForge project was initiated in 2000
and active development stopped in 2018.
New packages are not accepted, but existing packages are still maintained.
The project lists [56 members](https://sourceforge.net/p/octave/_members/)
(10 active and 46 dormant) maintaining existing Octave packages,
but not the source code of GNU Octave itself.

**Octave Packages** <https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/> is another
collection of Octave packages and intended successor of **Octave Forge**.
New packages are accepted here and the development of Octave packages
is independent of GNU Octave itself.

#### GitHub Organization

The GitHub Organization <https://github.com/gnu-octave/>
was established around 2020.
It is a loose connection of currently
[27 members](https://github.com/orgs/gnu-octave/people)
(10 active and 17 dormant)
developing software intended to be used with GNU Octave
(including **Octave Packages**),
but not the source code of GNU Octave itself.

### Questions
