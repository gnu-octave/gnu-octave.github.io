Octave is **free software**
used in countless research and production environments around the world.
The Octave project has grown and improved for over
[30 years]({{ "about.html" | relative_url }}) thanks to the efforts of
[more than 400 volunteers](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/file/tip/doc/interpreter/contributors.in),
and many private and corporate donations.

**Your contribution helps to ensure that Octave will continue to improve.**
