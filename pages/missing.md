If you are reading this page,
it is most likely because you attempted to use a function
that is part of Matlab,
but has yet to be implemented in Octave.
GNU Octave strives to be among the very best numerical tools available.
While compatibility with Matlab is one of many strong features of Octave,
we have not achieved 100% compatibility.

This is what you can do now:

- Check if the function is
  [part of some Octave package](https://octave.sourceforge.io/functions_by_alpha.php)
- [Report a bug]({{ "bugs.html" | relative_url }})
- [Implement the feature yourself]({{ "get-involved.html" | relative_url }})
- [Get commercial support]({{ "commercial-support.html" | relative_url }})
